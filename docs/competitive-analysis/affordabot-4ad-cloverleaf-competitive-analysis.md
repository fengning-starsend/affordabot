2. **Government Access**: Deep government relationships
3. **Market Validation**: Well-funded, growing market

## Integration Opportunities

### Tier 1: MEDIUM SYNERGY
```
Proposed Integration: "Implementation Cost Intelligence"

    compliance_requirements=local_regulations
)
total_bid_analysis = combine_project_and_compliance_costs(
    cloverleaf_opportunity, compliance_costs
)
```
